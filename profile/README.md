# AI Change Control (AICC)

AICC is an open specification defining enforceable contracts for AI-generated changes in software systems.

It defines an enforceable, implementation-agnostic contract for:

- **Intent** — what change is allowed  
- **Scope** — where changes may occur  
- **Guardrails** — constraints that must be enforced  
- **Verification** — how correctness is proven  
- **Approvals** — when humans must intervene  

AICC is designed to be **audit-first**, **execution-agnostic**, and **minimal by default**.
